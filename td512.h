// Notes for version 2.1.1:
/*
 1. In td512.c, for 128 and more values, text and extended string modes
    are called for checked data. For other data, and for any remaining values
    from calls for 128 or more values, td64 is called.
    A minimum of 16 characters are compressed.
 2. In tdString.c, extended string mode was modified to stop on the 65th
    unique value. This value is the last value output and the number
    of values at that point is returned.
 3. In main.c, after decompression, the input file is verified against
    the decompressed output file.
*/
// Notes for version 2.1.2:
/*
 1. In tdString.c, make the definition of string length and associated
    number of bits based on number of input values. For <= 64 values,
    length is 9 and bits are 3. For > 64 values, length is 17 and
    bits are 4. Longer strings are likely to be found in larger data sets.
 */
// Notes for version 2.1.3:
/*
 1. In td512.c, modified checktd64 to use the output of td64 call when possible.
 2. In td64.c, changed decodeAdaptiveTextMode to use arrays of bit positions and bits taken to maximize execution speed.
 */
// Notes for version 2.1.4:
/*
 1. In tdstring.c, extended string mode, continue processing after 64 unique values encountered for up to 64 additional non-unique values that are output as if they are unique values but are not indexed for string matching. The initial 64 unique values continue to be used. This improves compression for files with larger numbers of unique values, and reduces compression for some other files. The net result is better average compression.
 */
// Notes for version 2.1.5:
/*
 1. In tdstring.c, implemented 64-bit output of encoded values to improve compression speed.
 */
// Notes for version 2.1.6:
/*
 1. In td512.c, modified checkTextMode to return a code that causes use of extended string mode and improves compression speed. Also added ' (quote) to the text chars array.
 2. In td512.c, modified checktd64 (name change from checkSingleValueMode) to return a code for expected random data to be processed as a failing block of 64 bytes in the same way that td64 would handle this block.
 3. In td64.c, modified decodeAdaptiveTextMode to read one byte ahead to improve speed of processing dtbmPeekBits. This change can require one byte read beyond length of input array.
