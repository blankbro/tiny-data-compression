// Notes for version 2.1.1:
/*
 1. In td512.c, for 128 and more values, text and extended string modes
    are called for checked data. For other data, and for any remaining values
    from calls for 128 or more values, td64 is called.
    A minimum of 16 characters are compressed.
 2. In tdString.c, extended string mode was modified to stop on the 65th
    unique value. This value is the last value output and the number
    of values at that point is returned.
 3. In main.c, after decompression, the input file is verified against
    the decompressed output file.
*/
// Note for version 2.1.2:
/*
 1. In tdString.c, make the definition of string length and associated
    number of bits based on number of input values. For <= 64 values,
    length is 9 and bits are 3. For > 64 values, length is 17 and
    bits are 4. Longer strings are likely to be found in larger data sets.
